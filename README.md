# ML1020-MapReduce
York University School of Continuing Studies. ML1020. Personal Assignment

To run the code execute: `run_mapreduce [input_dir] [output_dir]`

The code was taken from : **https://pymotw.com/2/multiprocessing/mapreduce.html**. And then adjusted to my needs.
The program creates `number_of_CPU -1` threads.
